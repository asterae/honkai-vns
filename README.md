# Honkai VNs

Continuation of Chinese-to-English translation work of Honkai Impact VNs, from https://github.com/zklm/honkai-vns, in the form of edits to .xml files that can be loaded via zklm's scripts into the VN viewer.



## Standalone viewers

The standalone VN viewers made by zklm are available below:

- **Anti-Entropy:** https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-antientropy/ (Standalone)
- **Durandal:** https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-durandal/ (Standalone)
- **Seven Swords:** https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-sevenswords/ (Standalone)
  - Note: does not currently have UI settings that allow toggling between languages - so it is largely useless for translations. Perhaps someone with the relevant coding experience can look into enabling this.

### Known issues

- **Multi-line scrolling not available:** Multi-line scrolling in the dialog boxes is not working in the standalone VN viewers (e.g. https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-antientropy/) as it does in Mihoyo's original viewer (https://event.bh3.com/avgAntiEntropy/indexAntiEntropy.php). This is the case for both Chinese and translated text. I do not have experience in Javascript, nor do I have access to the code that allows loading of Mihoyo and custom resources into a standalone viewer. So I cannot remedy this.
    - Temporary solution: For now, people who want to read all the text should go to the "Log", or at least set font size in the settings to the smallest possible value.
    - **New Alternate Solution:** Thanks to a TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey script by [jericjan](https://github.com/jericjan) this issue can now be bypassed. Multi-line scrolling is working right now with the script enabled.

## Other miscellany

Please note that while I am of Asian background, I am not a native Mandarin speaker, nor am I 100% fluent in Chinese. All translation from my end was done with a healthy dose of Google Translate, mdbg.net, and what I could remember from Chinese School and TVB dramas. If there are any corrections/suggestions, please create an issue and I'll get to it when I can. Do note that you are also free to generate your own fork and create your own edits, provided full credit is given to all translators.

Personally, I am currently only working on the Anti-Entropy VN. However, other volunteers have started looking into the other VNs as well. I will upload what I have previously translated into each of the chapters of the Anti-Entropy VN (up to Chapter 12). If time and energy permits, and if there is public interest, I may also contribute to the remaining chapters and VNs, adding to the work already done so far.
